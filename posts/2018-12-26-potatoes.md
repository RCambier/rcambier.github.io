A farmer has 100kg of potatoes. At the start, they are composed of 99% of water (the water is 99% of the total weight) and 1% of dry matter (the dry matter is 1% of the total weight). 
Later, during storage and because of evaporation, the water percentage drops to 98%. 
What is the total weight of the potatoes then?

50kg.

At the start, there are 99kg of water and 1kg of dry matter. 
Later, the quantity of dry matter didn't change, but it is now representing 2% of the total mass. 
If 1kg is 2%, then 100% is 50kg.
