After solving the riddle of the three wise folks, three scoundrels claim to be the smartest in the country. So you decide to give them a challenge. Suspecting that the thing they care about most is money, you give them $100 and tell them they are to divide this money observing the following rule: they are to discuss offers and counter-offers from each other and then take a vote. Majority vote wins.
Sounds easy enough... now the question is, assuming each person is motivated to take the largest amount possible, what will the outcome be?

Note: careful... if the answer were that they split it 50% / 50% / 0%, or 1/3 / 1/3 / 1/3, it wouldn‘t be a riddle!

Note: careful... 96.6523544 % of people who send answers to this have not thought about it for even 1 minute. I guarantee you won‘t solve it in a minute. (96.6523544% of the time this guarantee is correct.)
