title: The blind pill

---

You are blind. 
You have 2 blue pills and 2 red pills in a box. 

You have to take 2 pills today and 2 tomorrow. Each day, exactly one blue and one red. 
If you don't, you will die. If you take more, you will die. 

How do you do it ?

One by one, you take the pill, break it in half, eat a half and keep the other half for tomorrow. 
This way, you will eat exactly 1 blue and 1 red pill per day.
